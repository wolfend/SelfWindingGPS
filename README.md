# SelfWindingGPS
Arduino code that works with Adafruit GPS shield and libraries to receive GPS time, display it on a 1.8" ST7735 128x128 TFT display, and generate a once per hour pulse at the top  of every hour on a digital output pin that is used to synchronize a Self Winding Clock Company clock. The digital output switches a reed relay (e.g., HE721A0500) installed on the shield that operates directly from the output pin. The relay is used to switch the output of a small 3.3V power supply module soldered on the shield. The reed relay I use has an internal snubber diode for its own coil's kickback but the contacts of the reed relay also need to be protected from the sizable kickback current from the synch coil in the clock using a snubber diode across the contacts.
A digital input pin is used to read a switch's state to set the time zone that is displayed: UTC or MST.
